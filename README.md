# Text-Only Counterstrike

A game created for the [XKCD game jam](https://itch.io/jam/xkcdgamejam) in a few days.

## Dependencies

This has only been tested on `python3`, and shouldn't require any other libraries. On Ubuntu, this can be done using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3
```

## Running

Run the following:

```
python3 Main.py
```

## Releases

If you are a Windows user, you might prefer to just download the binary (created using `cxfreeze`), removing the need to install python.

If so, check out the [itch.io page](https://dean36963.itch.io/text-only-counterstrike).
